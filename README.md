# 106: HackdaysLucerne - Quality of Life in Lucerne
What can the city administration of Lucerne do to enhance the quality of life for its residents?

## Challenge Definition
During a student project, the city administration of Lucerne invited city residents to answer an online questionnaire about their perceived quality of life. The result of this online questionnaire is a rich set of data from 630 participants.

Already during the student-project, many interesting insights could be read from the data. Nevertheless, we would like to dig a little deeper in this set of data.

## Ideas:
What coherences can be found?
How do the demographics influence the different aspects of life that are connected to quality of life?
What is your advice to the city administration?
The city administration is happy to use the results of this challenge to further improve quality of life in the city of Lucerne.
